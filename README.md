# React + Vite

Test


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


How about an overkill TODO app. Yes, TODO app... agaaain. Like an ongoing ever developing project. Start small, with just listing TODO's in an interesting way with an interesting layout (masonry, side scrolling, something, anything). The basic stuff, title, body, some states (like "done", priority levels etc.).

Then:

Add users, so users can login and have their own todos

Make sure both mobile and desktop experience are slick and usable

Add some filters (like different categories for cards/todos, priorities, status etc.) to filter and sort your todos

Add drag and drop rearrangement feature

Add date and time reminders

Pivot it towards KANBAN kind of app, with appropriate states and changes to layout. Maybe even support multiple layouts (KANBAN, classic, ...)

Add projects (or "rooms") that could contain several users, to support the KANBAN design

Add markdown editor to your "todo" body

Some sort of invite functionality to support the KANBAN design

Continue on adding features, swap some technologies somewhere along the journey to experience major PITA "refactorings"
